additionalType,URL,"An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.","Any ontology term describing the protein concept.

Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.","Additional to the use of name and description to describe this property in a human-readable way, additionalType should be used to specify the nature of the property/relation. For instance, if the property refers to a gene/protein disease association, you could use http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000983 as additionalType for the additionalProperty.

isContainedIn,BioChemEntity or URL,,"Indicates a BioChemEntity that this BioChemEntity is (in some sense) part of.

For proteins, it is recommended to at least specify the taxon/organism associated to the described protein; in this case the expected range would be a taxon id such as those in NCBI taxon or UniProt Taxonomy. Including as well the GO cellular locations is optional; in that case, the expected range would be a GO Cellular Location term.",Recommended,MANY,"NCBI Taxon, UniProt taxonomy"

For proteins, this property could be used, for instance, to register a sequence protein as a representation of the protein.
